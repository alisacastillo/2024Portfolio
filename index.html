            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a third year student pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Information Science, Systems, and Technology 
                with specializations in UX and Data Science at Cornell University. I also plan to pursue a minor in 
                Education. I am passionate about front-end development, project management, learning, and teaching.</p>

            <p> My goal is to explore new opportunities in computing, user interface design, AI/ML, product 
                development, and project management.</p>    
                
            <h2> Exploring my Portfolio </h2>
            <p> In this website, I plan to develop multiple pages from scratch to deep-dive in my academics, my interests,
            my experiences so far, and what I am currently pursuing. My first goal is creating the home page and a style for 
            my website. this is the page you are currently viewing. I will update here the changes I have made to this website. 
            The goal of my portfolio is to be a personal project where I learn more about how to use Git, Github, HTML, CSS, 
            and Javascript.</p>
